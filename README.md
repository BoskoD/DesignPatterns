##### - Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator

##### - Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility
